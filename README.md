A fast SAT Solver for Propositional Logic in Rust
----

Splr is a pure [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org)ic fast SAT solver, based on [Glucose 4.1](https://www.labri.fr/perso/lsimon/glucose/).
It adopts various research results on SAT solvers:

- *CDCL*, *watch literals*, *LBD* and so on from Glucose, [Minisat](http://minisat.se) and the ancestors
- Glucose-like *dynamic blocking/forcing restarts* based on [EMAs](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.08905) and [CaDiCaL](https://github.com/arminbiere/cadical)-like *stabilization*
- pre/in-process simplification based on clause subsumption and variable elimination
- compile-time selection of a variant of *Learning Rate Based Branching* with *Reason Side Rewarding* and EVSIDS
- *chronological backtrack* aka *chronoBT*
- Glucose-like heuristics adaptation
- CaDiCaL-like extended phase saving

*Many thanks to SAT researchers.*

Please check [ChangeLog](ChangeLog.md) about recent updates.

## Install

Just clone me, and `cargo install`, with `rustc` version 1.41 or upper.
Two executables will be installed:

- `splr` -- the solver
- `dmcr` -- A model checker to verify an assignment set which was generated by `splr`.

## Usage

Splr is a standalone program, taking a CNF file. The result will be saved to a file.

```plain
$ splr tests/sample.cnf

$ dmcr tests/sample.cnf

```

Since 0.4.0, you can use Splr in your programs.

```
use {
    splr::{
        solver::{Certificate, SatSolverIF, Solver},
        Config,
    },
    std::convert::TryFrom,
};

fn main() {
	let v: Vec<Vec<i32>> = vec![vec![1i32, 2], vec![-1, 3], vec![1, -3], vec![-1, 2]];
	let mut s = Solver::try_from((Config::default(), v.as_ref())).expect("It's UNSAT.");
	match s.solve() {
	    Ok(Certificate::SAT(ans)) => println!("s SATISFIABLE: {:?}", ans),
		Ok(Cetrificate::UNSAT) => println!("s UNSATISFIABLE"),
	    Err(e) => panic!("{}", e),
    }
}
```

## Correctness

Though Splr comes with **ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY**, I'd like to show some results.

#### Version 0.4.0 (splr-0.4.0)

* [SAT Race 2019](http://sat-race-2019.ciirc.cvut.cz), [Benchmarks](http://satcompetition.org/sr2019benchmarks.zip),  splr-0.4.0 solved with a 300 sec (soft) timeout:
  * 41 satisfiable problems: all the solutions were correct.
  * 5 unsatisfiable problems: all were verified with [Grad](https://www21.in.tum.de/~lammich/grat/).

#### Version 0.3.1 (splr-0.3.1)

* [SAT Race 2019](http://sat-race-2019.ciirc.cvut.cz), [Benchmarks](http://satcompetition.org/sr2019benchmarks.zip),  splr-0.3.1 solved with a 200 sec (soft) timeout:
  * 35 satisfiable problems: all the solutions were correct.
  * 4 unsatisfiable problems:
    * 3 were verified with Grad.
	* Verifying gto_p60c238-sc2018.cnf was timed out due to the size of the drat file (1.3 GB).

![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/997855/75087001-2f897800-557e-11ea-99fd-83d891f8350b.png)

#### Version 0.1.0 (splr-0.1.0)

* The first 100 problems from
  [SATLIB](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~hoos/SATLIB/benchm.html),
  [250 variables uniform random satisfiable 3-SAT](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~hoos/SATLIB/Benchmarks/SAT/RND3SAT/uf250-1065.tar.gz)
  : all the solutions were correct.
* The first 100 problems from
  [SATLIB](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~hoos/SATLIB/benchm.html),
  [250 variables uniform random unsatisfiable 3-SAT](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~hoos/SATLIB/Benchmarks/SAT/RND3SAT/uuf250-1065.tar.gz)
  : all the solutions were correct and verified with [drat-trim](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~marijn/drat-trim/).
* [SAT Competition 2017](https://baldur.iti.kit.edu/sat-competition-2017/index.php?cat=tracks),
  [Main track](https://baldur.iti.kit.edu/sat-competition-2017/benchmarks/Main.zip)
  : with a 2000 sec timeout, splr-0.1.0 solved:
  * 72 satisfiable problems: all the solutions were correct.
  * 51 unsatisfiable problems: [Lingeling](http://fmv.jku.at/lingeling/) or Glucose completely returns the same result. And,
     * 37 certificates generated by splr-0.1.1 were verified with drat-trim.
     * The remaining 14 certificates weren't able to be verified due to [timeout](https://gitlab.com/satisfiability01/splr/issues/74#note_142021555) by drat-trim.
